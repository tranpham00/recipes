    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Banh Tieu is a hollow Vietnamese donut, super soft and tender and coated with crispy sesame seeds.</p>
    <p>Vietnamese donuts aren't too sweet, and with the hollow inside, you can fill it with anything you want. Even though traditionally it's eaten as is.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>10 tbsp unsweetened almond milk (room temp)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup of oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>whisk together dry ingredients - flour, sugar, instant yeast, baking powder, and salt</li>
        <li>add wet ingredients - pour in milk and vanilla extract, mix with a spoon until dough forms</li>
        <li>knead - knead until smooth, for 5-7 minutes</li>
        <li>proof the dough - cover with plastic film, let it proof for 1hr 30min, or until double in size</li>
        <li>divide into balls - punch to deflate, divide into six balls</li>
        <li>roll into sesame seeds - roll one ball at a time into the sesame seeds, slightly pressing down so it sticks</li>
        <li>flatten into discs - flatten each ball to about 3-4mm thick</li>
        <li>heat oil - heat oil in deep saucepan over medium heat. dip wooden chopstick in- if bubbles form around chopstick, oil is hot enough</li>
        <li>deep fry - carefully add one disc of dough to oil at a time. flip every 5-7 seconds</li>
        <li>remove from oil - remove once golden brown, transfer to plate with paper towel to remove excess oil. repeat with remaining discs</li>
        <li>let banh tieu cool for at least five minutes. enjoy fresh, or up to 2 days in airtight container at room temperature</li>
